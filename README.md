# eink-screen-esp32

This is a monorepo containing some simple code for a simple web app that controls my eink screen (with an ESP32 driver).

## Software

There are 2 distinct codebases:

1. Backend (`/backend`) - web interface and API server
2. MCU codebase (`/mcu`) - code that runs on the eink screen MCU

The general set-up is as follows:

- The backend runs on a sever (via Docker)
- Users use the web interface to configure the display
- The MCU connects to WiFi and periodically fetches an image from the backend and displays it
