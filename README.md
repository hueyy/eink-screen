# eink-screen-esp32

This is a monorepo containing some simple code for a tiny web app that controls my eink screen (with an ESP32 driver).

## Software

There are 3 distinct codebases:

1. Web app (`/frontend`) - static site that is served by the backend
2. Backend (`/backend`) - backend server running on a Raspberry Pi Zero
2. MCU codebase (`/mcu`) - code that runs on the eink screen MCU

The general set-up is as follows:

- The Raspberry Pi hosts a local WiFi network which the ESP32 connects to
- The backend runs on the Raspberry Pi and serves up the frontend
- Whenever an instruction is given via the frontend, the backend receives it and forwards it to the ESP32
