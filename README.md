# eink-screen-esp32

This is a monorepo containing some simple code for a tiny web app that controls my eink screen (with an ESP32 driver). I have since switched to using a Raspberry Pi to drive the eink screen so I am no longer maintaining this repository and therefore have archived it.

## Software

There are 2 distinct codebases:

1. Web app (`/frontend`) - static site
2. MCU codebase (`/mcu`) - code that runs on the eink screen MCU

## Hardware
